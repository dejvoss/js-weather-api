# Web Weather Station app

Application display the current weather based on the user location.

It is a simple application that uses the Weather and GEO API to display the current weather based on the user location and user city.

As APIs required keys I have split app for frontend and backend, where backend is very simple flask application for sending request to APIs and return weather information to frontend JavaScript app. 

App shows that any device with internet and screen can be turned into weather station, an old tablet as example.

The APIs have limitation in daily requests, therefore if you are not seeing the weather information, please try again later.
